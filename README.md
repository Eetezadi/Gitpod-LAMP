This is a template repo, you can create your own using this as a template. Or let Gitpod handle the fork on the first commit.

## What this does

* Uses a Gitpod dockerfile based on Ubuntu Linux to configure Apache, mySQL, PHP and adds also XDebug (based on Gitpod Image "workspace-mysql)
* Runs Apache2 on port 8080 serving from directory "www"
* Follows the Apache logs in the Gitpod terminal view via multitail
* Runs mySQL together with PhpMyAdmin

## Things to do
* On first start wait until the browser window opens...
* Open PhpMyAdmin in the browser to setup your databases and configure users
* Try XDebug on debug_example.php
* Build your own project...hope this saved you some time :)
